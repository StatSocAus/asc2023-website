# ASC and OZCOTS 2023 website

This repository contains a copy of the website for the Australian Statistical
Conference (ASC) and Australian Conference on Teaching Statistics (OZCOTS) held
in 2023.

It was originally hosted by [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) at the
domain <www.asc2023.org>.  The subscriptions for both will utimately lapse, so
we made this copy for archival purposes.

The script `download.sh` was used to create the copy.

The pages were subsequently amended to include PDF copies of the program and
abstracts, which was info that was previously only on the Oxford Abstracts
platform that was used to host that content.
